# Project Name
EMP Drone

## Check out my project website
https://tinkeridea.github.io/EMP-Drone/

## Summary

I am trying to design this drone and the EMP is also designed by me for military purposes in which the drone can shoot electromagnetic pulse whose inert voltage is 1000 kV or one million volts, and it can be used to disperse the planted bombs and protect our military force if someone is running using the vehicle, we just have to fly this drone over that car or truck and this drone can emit electromagnetic pulse and break all the circuits inside the vehicle and so that vehicle can be stopped. Also, if we use this drone in suspicious areas where bombs can be planted, the EMP dispenses or disposes all the bombs easily within minutes and hence this project will contribute a lot to our Army.

## Plan

After doing the lot of research my plan is:
1. I have to made 3D Desgin in fusion 360 which is alredy maded.
2. I will order parts of drone.
3. I need my drone small and cheap so I will custamize my drone and will try to make some parts of drone. I already made 1 part which is power-distribution. I will use my 3D printer of school.
4. Testing of drone.
5. I will add some safety to make drone safe from EMP.
6. Build a device which converts 1 volt to 7,000-10,000 volt. I will parts of EMP according to my research. Already done some testing of this device in school. and works perfectly.
7. After this I will make EMP and will run the test becuase it should be match each device frequency and have a light weight.
8. EMP will be customizable according to device.
9. Review the safety features.
10. When all device will be done I assemble all devices according to 3D model.
11. I will check agian the safety.
12. After all of this stuff my project is ready to take-off.
