# Project Name
EMP Drone

## Summary

I am trying to design this drone and the EMP is also designed by me for military purposes in which the drone can shoot electromagnetic pulse whose inert voltage is 1000 kV or one million volts, and it can be used to disperse the planted bombs and protect our military force if someone is running using the vehicle, we just have to fly this drone over that car or truck and this drone can emit electromagnetic pulse and break all the circuits inside the vehicle and so that vehicle can be stopped. Also, if we use this drone in suspicious areas where bombs can be planted, the EMP dispenses or disposes all the bombs easily within minutes and hence this project will contribute a lot to our Army.

## Plan

My first taget is to custamize my drone to custamize my drone to do that I am going to buy 3D printer and then I will make small device which is going to attach in my drone. I already made a 3D the design of this.
